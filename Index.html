      { number: 1, term: "Frontal Lobe", definition: "The largest part of the brain. Responsible for planning, decision-making, voluntary muscle movements, and problem-solving." },
      { number: 2, term: "Parietal Lobe", definition: "Processes sensations and allows you to interpret touch, temperature, pain, and pressure. Provides spatial awareness and understanding of your bodyâ€™s position in relation to your surroundings." },
      { number: 3, term: "Temporal Lobe", definition: "Processes auditory information such as sound and speech. Stores memories. Allows object and facial recognition as well as language understanding." },
      { number: 4, term: "Occipital Lobe", definition: "Allows you to process color, depth, and distance. Shares visual information to other parts of the brain to process." },
      { number: 5, term: "Cerebellum", definition: "Located on the back of your head. Coordinates muscles. Maintains balance and posture." },
      { number: 6, term: "Motor Cortex", definition: "Allows you to plan, control, and execute voluntary movements. Helps initiate complex actions." },
      { number: 7, term: "Sensory Cortex", definition: "Processes and integrates sensory information, such as touch, sight,smell,sound and taste." },
      { number: 8, term: "Corpus Callosum", definition: "Functions like a bridge. Nerve fibers that allow the brain to connect the left and right hemispheres. Plays a role in how you think, remember, and coordinate movements." },
      { number: 9, term: "Thalamus", definition: "Main relay station for the brain. All senses except smell must be processed through here before getting sent to the cerebral cortex. Plays a role in sleep, consciousness, and memory." },
      { number: 10, term: "Hypothalamus", definition: "The brainâ€™s control center. Regulates temperature and manages hormones." },
      { number: 11, term: "Pituitary Gland", definition: "Produces hormones which regulate normal bodily functions." },
      { number: 12, term: "Medulla", definition: "Controls things like breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. Link between the brain and the spinal cord, which makes it important for motor functions." },
      { number: 13, term: "Hippocampus", definition: "Involved in forming new memories and long-lasting ones, plays a part in navigation. Manages responses to certain memories, like rewards and punishments." },
      { number: 14, term: "Limbic System", definition: "Regulates emotions, memory, motivation and basic survival instincts. Crucial for storing memories." },
      { number: 15, term: "Brain Stem", definition: "Connects cerebrum to spinal cord. Relays sensory and motor functions to the rest of the body." },
      { number: 16, term: "Reticular Formation", definition: "Coordinates things like sleep schedule, consciousness, attention and motor control. Acts as a filter for sensory information." },
      { number: 17, term: "Amygdala", definition: "Processing emotions and the flight or fight response. It is the brain's threat detection." },
      { number: 18, term: "Broca's Area", definition: "Helps make thoughts become fluent spoken words. Helps with grammar and the way we construct sentences." },
      { number: 19, term: "Wernicke's Area", definition: "Language comprehension. Holds the mental representation of sounds, which helps distinguish different words." },
      { number: 20, term: "Pons", definition: "A relay of sensory and motor functions. Helps to regulate breathing, managing sleep cycles and movement." },
      { number: 21, term: "Visual Cortex", definition: "Receives and processes information from the eyes. Enables the ability to see different colours, see movement and help understand depth." },
      { number: 22, term: "Auditory Cortex", definition: "Processes all auditory information. Is necessary to understanding language." },
      { number: 23, term: "Angular Gyrus", definition: "Takes in information for things like reading, writing and spatial awareness. Uses information from other sensory inputs to comprehend concepts and other information." }
